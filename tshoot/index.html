      <p>You are not seeing any buttons on the EduGo home page because there are no pages that can be visible to the public yet.</p>

      <p>The GitHub user ‘MasterD2012’ is trying his best to get this page and many other pages in different branches suitable for release. He is also working on many other updates on those websites to keep it modern and also optimised for future and current devices. As a result of these things that are going on right now (along with many other things) he hasn’t gotten around to adding features to this site. He is sorry for any inconvenience that has been caused due to these things.</p>
